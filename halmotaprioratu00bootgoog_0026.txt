occasionally on payment of a fine in addition to the
rent. Usually the rent of the demesnes was payable
at the Exchequer of the Prior in Durham, but as the
rent of the bondage tenements was occasionally directed
to be paid at the Exchequer, no inference as to the
nature of the tenure ean be made from this circum· .
stanee. In East Rainton (p. 101) the demesnes are
demised to four tenants for a term of yearS, under
conditions which were probably usual in similar (101111808,
viz„ to manure a certain proportion of the land each
year, to leave the buildings as they received them, and
the land, as to the ploughing, as they entered, to grind
their corn at the lord's mill, as they were liable to grind
who held husbandry lands.

In Billingham (p. 34) John Hardgill is admitted to
the maner (manerium), which would seem to have
included the lord's demesne lands and buildings, for the
term of his life, at a yearly rent, and 111 form similar to
the admittances to what may be termed, for the sake
of distinction, the customary or township lands held for
life, viz„ faciendo domino ct vicinis quae incumbunt,
and he pays a fine on entry. In the same vill (p. 104)
a bondage tenement is taken, with ten acres of the
demesneS‚ for life, and there are numerous other
instances where the demesne lands are taken with other
landS, and without any difference 111 form. There is

doubted whether all customary tenures are so deseended.
Here, however, we may perhaps trace the transition
