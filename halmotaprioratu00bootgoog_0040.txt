three white loaves of bread were being carried to Westoe
when the servants of John Gray and his wife ate them
(Fullwell, p. 69). In Billingham (p. 179) we find the

Bursar providing for a supply to himself of young
pigeons by the farmers of the doveeot. Another duty
the tenants were bound to perform was the provision of
beds for those attending the court. Occasionally we
find a knotty point brought before the court, as at-

by the King's officers to do carriage towards the north,
and never returned. Whereupon the baih'ff complained

was better understood, have admitted the factS, and
demurred in law to the claim on the ground that the
damages were too remote from the cause of action. In
the present case the claim was respited until it could be

come with sound sacks and in daylight. Another case
occurs under Fery (p. 163), when we find a tenant in
tail, after possibility of issue was extinct, conveying in
see-sim ple, to avoid an escbeat, the tenant in remainder
