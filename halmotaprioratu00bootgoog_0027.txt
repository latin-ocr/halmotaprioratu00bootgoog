The position of the free tenants with regard to the
Halmote Court is somewhat obscure, and the more so

Court (Ayoliffe, pp. 155, 171).

In Wolveston (p. 109) we find admittanee taken to

rent in addition to the free rent. In East Merrington
(p. 104) the freeholders were charged with their
proportion of the repairs of the “ lonynges '² and of
the mill (p. 86). In the same vill a tenant of thirty
