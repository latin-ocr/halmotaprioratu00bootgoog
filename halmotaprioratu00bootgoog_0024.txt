and presentments of· those who were of this condition,
and where they were residing. The niefs were required
to do fealty in court, in proof of their servile condition.
In Billingham (p. 123) we have the form of oath‚ “ that
he will be true to the Lord Prior and convent, and to
their servants, in body and goods‚ and that he will not
take himself from their land.'' The niefs who were in
possession of bondage tenements (bondayz‘a) held, not
for hfe, as the other tenants‚ but at the will of the lord,
and this variation from the usual form is usually ex-
plained in the roll, quia nativus. Tenants so holding
at the will of the lord do not appear to have been sub-
ject to fines on entry (see under Jarmw, p. 84). It
seemS, however, not to have been inconsistent with the
condition of a nief that he should hold of the Prior other
land for life. Thus we find John Yotson, a nief of the
lord, taking a cottage and ten acres for the term of his
life (Hesledon‚ p. 132), and again, under Billingham,
Robert Yotson‚ the lord's nief‚ is similarly admitted.
Such of the bondage tenements as were held for life
were probably held by tenants, husband& who were not
of the condition of niefs: under Billingham (p. 104)
and Cowpen (p. '7 9) wc find instanees of bondage tene-
ments so held. Niefs appear to have been sensitive of
their condition, for frequent injunctions against calling
them “rustics’' occur. In Wolveston we meet with an
injunction on all the tenants of the vill tha-t none call
the lord’s niefs rusticos under a penalty of twenty·
shillings‚ and in the Raintons (p. 33) the tenants are
even forbidden to call any one in those vills a nief‚
under a similar penalty.
