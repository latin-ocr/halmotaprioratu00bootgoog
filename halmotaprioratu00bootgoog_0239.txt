¹ The grammar, or want of grammar, in the Survey‚ ie so peculiar, that,
in deforence to its writer, many 00an words have boen left so, aa their
extenuion in the usual way might not have met with his approval. The
worda have not been extended where thore was tho slighteet doubt aa
to whether singular οι· plural was meant.
For convenience, especially of comptu-ison with the Buram-'s Rentul of
1539, tho Roman numerals in sums have men supplied by Arabio figures.
