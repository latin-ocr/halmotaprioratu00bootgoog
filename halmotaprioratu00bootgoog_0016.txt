X PREFAGE.

Chapter of Durham. They are written on skins of parch-
ment, stitched together in Ohancery fashion into a long
roll twelve inches wide, and of varying length, but gene-
rally about eight feet. The entries are carried in dorso
as far as the necessities of the scribe, whose business it
was to transcribe the proceedings of the Court, required.
The condition of many of the rolls shows they have suffered
from damp, and consequent decay. The handwriting
is clear and legible‚ except where the skins are worn
by frequent rolling and unrolling‚ which have neces-
sarily affected that portion of the manuscript carried to
the back of the rolls‚ The Latinity is faulty, the result-
in most cases of carelessness. Many of the errors have
been silently corrected in the text of this volume, to
prevent the inconvenience which would have been
caused by calling more frequent attention to the gram-
matical errors of the scribe; enough, however, remain
to justify the charge of carelessness The rolls are not
printed in their entirety‚ which would have involved
much useless repetition of similar matter. But no
entry has wittingly been left unnoticcd which throws
any light on the tenures of the land or the ways and
habits of the people.

 

The period embraced in the present volume is from ³
A.D. 1296 to A.D. 1384. There are, however, consider- ¹

able gaps between these dates.

Thus, prior to 1365 the rolls for the years 1296, 1300,
1309, 1332, 1333, 1340 2, 1345, 1347, 1356, 1357-
1366, and 1364, are alone preserved, and often in a
very fragmentary form. From 1365 to the end of the
present volume the series is complete.
