PREFACE. xv

(p. 10), William Maye took a toft and land, which Alan,
son of Peter, held, who during his life was to have lodg-
ing in the toft, and three roods of land, in each field
one rood. See also Monkton (p. 9). The widow invari-
ably succeeded in widow-right to the holding of her hus-
band for life. The fine (yersuma) on entry appears to
have been certain, and not excessive‚ and frequently was
remitted, in whole or in part. Without the lord's eon·
sent she could not marry again. Under Newton Bewley
(p. 59) a widow‚ admitted to two messuages and sixty
aeres, is prohibited from marrying again under a fine of
four poundS. If she married she remained tenant, and
was responsible for the aceustomed services», but she,
with her husband, might surrender her tenement. Thus
under Ayeliffe (p. 23) we see John F ermour admitted to
a cottage which Emma, the wife of Gilbert Randolf, held,
and which they (Gilbert and Emma) then surrendered ;
and again, under East Rainton (p. 21), we find John
Freman admitted to his mother's holding, which she and
Robert Thompson, who had married her, surrendered in
court to his use. After the widow's death perhaps
family considerations rather than oustom regulated the
right to admittanee. Under Billingham (p. 104) we
find the husband admitted to the holding of his late
wife; but under Fulwell the son takes the holding of
his mother, and her husband undertakes to repair a
grange with a pair of “siles ’² and two “gavil fores'' to
the eontentment of the son. If the widow did not wish
to hold her husband’s tenement‚ his heir, or, in default,
any of his blood, had the option of succeeding, and fail-
ing these, the lord would admit any one willing to fine ;
