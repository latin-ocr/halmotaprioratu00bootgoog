when required for repairs‚ whether in gross or as
‘⁶ siles‚’' “firsts‚'' “ spars,'' and “ ribs,” is specially
allowed by the lord or his officere. For deterioration
of land, not manuring, or taking manure out of the
lordship, damages are assessed ; also for cultivating out
of course, as in Willington (p. 105), where we see a
tenant had taken a crop of oats instead of beans or
peas. TrespasseS, as might be expected, on the neigh-
bour’s corn, when the open-field system of cultivation
was in use, are frequent. Hirsill, or the obligation of
the tenants to send their cattle, geese‚ and pigs from the
vill under proper custody, would obviate to some extent
the want of fences ; but we constantly find hot disputes
among the tenants from this cause, which often led
first to hard words and then to blow5. Indeed, the
frequent orders upon the tenants not to transgress in
word or deed, or with staveS, ειη-ονε, or knives, and the
numerous fines for drawing knives to strike, and (though
less frequently) striking with kniveS, and the volu-
bility of the villans in court, rather suggest some points
of resemblance between the tenants of the Prior and
the peasantry of to-day in our sister isle. Attendance
at the lord's court was strictly enforced, and the fines
for absence, or being late, are frequent. Contempt of
court was not unknown; thus we find fines imposed
for refusing to be silent in court, speaking contemptu-
ously of the jury, and imputing to them falsehood.
Brewing of beer appears to have been farmed from
the Prior. It was therefore necessary to give brewers

protection, and accordingly we find it an offence to buy
beer outside the vill and sell it within. In Shields
