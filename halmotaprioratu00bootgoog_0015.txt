Court of the Prior and Convent, and commences with
the earliest roll extant, viz, for the year 1296.

Besides affording much information as to the conditione
on which the land was held, and the methods of its culti-
vation, they give us a vivid picture of the rural popula-
tion of the county of Durham during the period covered
by the rolls 3 indeed, it is hardly a figure of speech to
say we have in them village life photographed. The
dry record of tenures is peopled by the men and women
who occupied them, whose acquaintance we make in
these records under the various phases of village life.
We see them in their tofts, surrounded by their crofts‚
with their gardens of pot-herbS. We 666 how they
ordered the affairs of the village when summoned by
the bailiff of 1116 vill to consider matters which affected
the common weal of the community. We hear of their
trespasses and wrong-doings, and how they were
remedied or punished 3 of their strifes and 60111611110116,
and how they were repressed 3 of their attemptS, not
always ineffective‚ 10 grasp the principle of co-operation
as shown by 111611 bye-laws 3 of their relations with the
Prior, who represented the convent and alone stood in
relation of lord. He appears always 10 have dealt with
his tenants‚ either in person or through his officers, with
much consideration 3 and in the imposition of fines we
find them invariably tempering justice with mercy.
But of their contents, more presently.

The Court Rolls which are printed in the present
volume are preserved in the Treasury of the Dean and

Durham, but now in the county of prised the vills of East and West
Nerthumberland, and which com- Sleekburn, Cambois, and Bedlington.
