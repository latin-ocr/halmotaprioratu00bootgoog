varnos. xix

One condition under which all the-lord’s tenants held
was that none could let or exchange their holdingS, in
whole or in part, without the lord's licence. If this were
done without authority, the holding was seized into the
lord's hands, and the tenant would only be readmitted
, 011 payment of a further fine. In Wolveston (p. 68),
william Sergaunt we find so readmitted to a messuage

has leave to let three acres in each field, one acre for
the term of his life. The liability to maintain and
leave in sufficient repair the buildings on their holdings
was strictly enjoined and enforced, though the lord
generally found timber for the purpose. If the tenant
left house, grange, or other building out of repair, the
damages were assessed by the jury, and the goods of
the defaulting tenant arrested for making the necessary
reparation3 for a proceeding of this nature see under
Dalton (p. 129).

If there was a difficulty in finding a tenant, the
vacant holding would be assigned to those who were
of sufficient means to cultivate it3 thus we see in
Pittington (p. 33) a messuage with twenty-eight· aeres,
assigned to two tenants, who are found by the jury
able (potentes) to hold it, and in Billingham (p. 45),
where the lands held by former tenants are assigned to
all the husbandmen of the vill to answer for the rent3
also in Cowpen, where three acres, long lying waste, are
assigned to all the tenants of the vill, until some tenant
should come who should be willing to take them.

The demesne lands of the vill or lordship were
demised at the lord’s court, and the tenants admitted,
