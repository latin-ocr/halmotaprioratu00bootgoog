Parnon. xvii

In the vills subject to the Halmote Oourt, the
rents were not fixed and certain during the period
covered by this volume. The ancient (otntiqutws)¹
rent was frequently increased‚ and as frequently
abated, from which we may infer at this period it
was in the nature of a rack·rent, and varied with the
capabilities of the land or the circumstances of the
tenant. It varied from 6d. to ls. per acre. In this
respect the tenants of the Bishop's manors were on a
more favourable footing, as may be seen in comparing
the rents and services of the hond-tenantS, as recorded
in Boldon Buke and Hatfield's Survey. In both Surveys
they are found the same, though two hundred years
intervened. But with regard to the money payments of
the Prior's tenantS, it must be observed that careful con-
sideration appears to have been given to the circum-
stances and condition of the tenantS, as the instances
are numerous where payment is allowed to be postponed
or abated. Under Spennymoor (p. 16) we see an
allowance made to the widow of a former tenant of half
the yearly rent on acqount of her age and weakness of
mind.

Those tenants who were niefs (nativi) of the lord were,
in the language of the law-books, yleboe adscripti, and
could not leave the vill without the lord's licence. If
they left the vill they required the lord's licence, and a
payment was made, pro albanaria, i.e. for the privilege
of living under another lord (see Shields‚ p. 185).

Hence we find frequent inquiries in the lord's court,

¹ 'rho word antiquus, however, (Sheles) we find Alice Morros ad·
may not necessarily imply the rent monished to forsake her old habits
vas of long standing. At p. 181 (antiquos more-⁹).
