XXX PREFAOE.

(p. 32) we find Richard Burdon, Richard Harper, and
Rohert Benedicite buying beer at Newcastle, and selling
it at Shields, to the injury of the farmers of the brew-
house.

The retailing of ale was in the hands of the female

tenants. The fines for breach of assize of ale occur Ἰ
very frequently. There seems to have been also ocea— ³

sionally a reluctance to sell off the premissa, and at the
price fixed by the tasters. In one instance, Alice de
Bellassus had the hardihood to send bad beer to the
Terrar, which was proved in court to be of no value.
The assize and quality of bread sold were under the
regulations of the vill, and we find it an offence to sell
bread baked with unsound corn 3 but the complaints as

regards bread are rar‘er than those made of the quality ¹

and price of the beer, and for refusing to sell off the
premiseS. Of other offences, that most frequently
noticed on¹ the Court Rolls and compounded for is
Leyrwit. Incontinence was common in the vills. In
a note on p. 152 are given the numbers, in two circuita

 

for 1378, of those who pay for merchet, and of those
who are fined for incontinence. Merchet was the regular ἓ

payment made by a nief on the marriage of his daugh-

ter, but in these two years (which fairly represent the

proportion in other years) they are considerably less in
number than fines for leyrwit. Such a record as we
find (p. 13), where Preciosa, the daughter of the Vicar
of Merrington‚ is so fined, is at least sad.

It does not appear on what grounds the tenants
were forbidden to play “ ad pilam‚'’ if a game at ball
is meant, unless some element of gambling were in-
