xvi PREFACE.

but the tenants, whether of the blood of the previous
holder or 0111616, 616 invariably admitted for life. Thus,
in Pittington (p. 36) John Punshon is admitted for life
to the tenement of Peter Hudson‚ as neither his widow
nor any of his blood wished to fine ; in Shields (p. 44) a
tenement is taken at an increased rent for life, as none
of the blood of the previous tenant wished to fine3 in
Ferry (p. 86), a tenement is taken by Matilda, who
was the wife of John Simson, formerly John Hodds,
which came into the Prior's hands in consequence of his
dying without an heir ; -and in Southwick (p. 122) Elias
Raven is admitted to a moiety of a bondage tenement‚
which the widow of the previous tenant held in widow-
right, as none of his blood wished to fine. Of the blood
of the last tenant, the heir would, no doubt, be preferred,
but in Shields (p. 18) we have an instance of a toft being
divided into 1110161166, and taken by the two sons of the
previous tenant, but being found of tender years, and
unable to disposc of the toft, a guardian is appointed for
eight years, who is to repair and sustain the toft at his
own costS, he having the profitS. He is also to main-
tain the infants in food and clothing, and to lodge them
in the toft. At the end of eight years the two sons are
to have and to hold it peaceably, without hindrance of
the guardian. It would almost seem that in this
instance the sons were twinS, and the entry is excep-
tional in other respectS, as showing a larger estate than
usual in the tenant, and that there was a riyht of dis-
position. In Aycliffe (p. 34) we find the admittance of
another infant son in succession to 1116 father, and a
guardian assigned to him.
