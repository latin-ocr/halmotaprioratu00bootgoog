volved in the game.¹ There are frequent injunctions
to the tenants not to play. In East Merrington (p. 175)
we see the constables of the vin charged not to allow
any to play “ad pilam '' under a penalty of 40s. In
Southwick (p. 171) the play appears to have led to a
breach of the peace, and the tenants of the Prior were
in great bodily danger from the Lord of Hilton's men.
Arising out of this is a curious order, that the Prior's
tenantS, on any trespass or wrong done within the lord-
ship, are not to seek aid from another lord‚ nor procure
his servants to intermeddle.

Another class of offences of which we find numerous
presentments was what we would now call poaching,
and the offenders are frequently found to be in a station
of life which we might have expected would have rc-
moved thern from temptation. In Aycliffe (p. 147),
Robert Chauncelor, John Cailes, and William Powys
(capellani) are found to be common hunters, and taking
hares in the field of Acley. A similar presentment is
made against Dominus John Gray and others in Pitting-
ton (p. 151), and the Vicar of Hesylden (Ρ. 125),
against the master of Westpittell in Heworth (p. 1 78) for
hunting with his servants within the lord's warren, and
against William Clericus de Tynemouth in Wallsend
(p. 155). In this vill the tenants are forbidden to keep
greyhounds for taking hares (p. 165). Le Hopp at
