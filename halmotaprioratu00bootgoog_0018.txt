xii PRErAcr..

Prior had a manor house, be held in its hall, and therefore,
as we might expect, the Prior himself was frequently pre-
sent. In 1374, 1375, and 1376, we find the court held
before the Prior, Bursar, and Steward, the Prior sitting
as a component part of the court, but in these instances
the Terrar was absent. The circuits or turni did not in-
variably commenc'e at the same place, nor was the same
order always preserved in making the circuit. The pro-
ceedings in each Vill or Township were kept distinct3 thus
the name of the vill is written in the margin of the roll,
then follow the names of the jurors‚ with such matters
as relate to that vill. In some cases two or more of the
vills appear to have been grouped into lordships, and
within each lordship, or at some convenient manor
house of the Prior, the Oourt would sit, and thither
those who owed suit and service would be summoned.
The following is a list of the vills subject to the juris-
diction of the Halmote Court alphabetically arranged.
How they came, or were claimed to have come, into
the possession of the Convent is exhaustively treated by
Canon Greenwell in his Preface to Feodavdum Prion-atus
Dunelmensis‚ vol. lviii. of the Society's publicatione.
